## ChatGPT Agent Reddit Marketing Prompt for CraveMap

**YOU ARE TO EXECUTE THESE TASKS DIRECTLY - NOT PROVIDE INSTRUCTIONS**

**IMPORTANT: DO NOT give me instructions on how to do these steps. You are to GO TO REDDIT.COM, LOG IN, and EXECUTE these tasks yourself. I want you to actually perform the actions, not tell me how to do them.**

**ACCOUNT ACCESS REQUIREMENTS:**
- Go to reddit.com
- Log in using my credentials (alvincheong@u.nus.edu account)
- You should already have access to this account
- If you don't have access, tell me immediately and request login credentials
- Use this account for ALL Reddit activities

**CRITICAL SAFETY RULES - READ FIRST:**
- NEVER spam or post the same content multiple times
- ALWAYS read each subreddit's rules before posting
- NEVER be overly promotional - focus on value and story
- ONLY post 1-2 times per day maximum across ALL subreddits
- If mods remove a post, STOP and analyze why before posting elsewhere

**YOUR MISSION:**
Go to Reddit, log in, and execute a complete marketing campaign for CraveMap. The app is at: https://cravemap.streamlit.app/

**YOU WILL DO ALL OF THIS - NOT TELL ME HOW TO DO IT**

**APP DETAILS:**
- **Product**: CraveMap - AI-powered restaurant finder based on food cravings
- **Target Market**: Singapore food lovers, tech enthusiasts
- **Pricing**: $9.99 SGD/month for premium (unlimited searches)
- **Free Tier**: 3 searches per month
- **Unique Value**: Understands natural language cravings ("something spicy and comforting")

**PHASE 1: RESEARCH - YOU EXECUTE THIS**

### 1. Subreddit Analysis - DO THESE STEPS:
GO TO each subreddit below and ANALYZE them. For each subreddit, you will:
- VISIT the subreddit page
- READ the rules in the sidebar
- SCROLL through recent posts to see what gets upvoted
- CHECK posting times by looking at successful posts
- IDENTIFY the best post format (image, text, video)
- WRITE DOWN moderator activity level

**YOU WILL VISIT THESE SUBREDDITS AND ANALYZE THEM:**
1. Go to `/r/singapore` (500K) - Local market, highest conversion potential
2. Go to `/r/SideProject` (200K) - Indie maker community  
3. Go to `/r/food` (27M) - Massive food community
4. Go to `/r/InternetIsBeautiful` (17M) - Cool web tools
5. Go to `/r/recipes` (4M) - Food enthusiasts
6. Go to `/r/MachineLearning` (2M) - AI angle

### 2. Competitor Analysis - YOU DO THIS:
- SEARCH Reddit for "restaurant app", "food finder", "AI food" posts
- LOOK at how they performed (upvotes, comments)
- READ the comments to see what people liked/disliked
- IDENTIFY what angles haven't been used yet

**PHASE 2: CONTENT CREATION - YOU WRITE THE POSTS**

Based on your research, you will WRITE 5 different post variations. Use the templates below but CUSTOMIZE them based on what you learned from each subreddit.

### 1. YOU WILL CREATE These 5 Posts:

**A. Problem/Solution Story (for /r/singapore, /r/food)**
```
Title: "Got tired of scrolling through delivery apps for 30 minutes, so I built an AI that finds restaurants based on cravings"

Suggested Body:
"You know that feeling when you're craving 'something spicy and comforting' but spend forever scrolling through GrabFood/Foodpanda without finding what you want?

I'm a Singaporean developer and got so frustrated with this that I built CraveMap. Instead of browsing by cuisine or restaurant name, you just describe your craving in natural language.

Examples:
- 'I want something warm and soup-like for this rainy weather'
- 'Craving spicy Korean but not too heavy'
- 'Need comfort food but trying to eat healthier'

The AI understands context and finds restaurants that actually match your mood and craving.

It's free to try (3 searches) - would love feedback from fellow food lovers!

[Include screenshot of the app interface]"
```

**B. Technical/Indie Maker Angle (for /r/SideProject, /r/MachineLearning)**
```
Title: "Built an AI restaurant finder that understands natural language cravings - 6 months from idea to launch"

Body: "As a side project, I wanted to solve the 'what should I eat?' problem using AI.

Tech stack:
- Frontend: Streamlit (rapid prototyping)
- AI: OpenRouter API for natural language processing
- Maps: Google Places API
- Payments: Stripe
- Deployment: Streamlit Cloud

The interesting challenge was training the AI to understand food cravings vs just cuisine types. 'Something comforting' means different things in different contexts.

Lessons learned:
- Streamlit is amazing for MVP development
- Natural language food search is harder than expected
- Users actually prefer describing cravings over browsing categories

It's live at https://cravemap.streamlit.app/ - would love technical feedback!"
```

**C. Local Singapore Angle (for /r/singapore)**
```
Title: "Made an app that actually understands Singapore food cravings"

Body: "Tired of delivery apps that don't get local context?

This one knows the difference between:
- 'Want zi char but not too oily' 
- 'Craving Western but affordable'
- 'Need prata but good quality one'

Built specifically with Singapore food culture in mind. The AI understands local terms and context.

Free to try: https://cravemap.streamlit.app/

As a local developer, curious what fellow Singaporeans think!"
```

**D. Interactive Demo (for /r/InternetIsBeautiful)**
```
Title: "Website that finds restaurants by reading your mind (almost) - describe any food craving and it finds matches"

Body: "This is pretty cool - instead of browsing by cuisine or price, you just describe what you're in the mood for.

Try these:
- 'Something warm and soupy for rainy day'
- 'Healthy but still satisfying'
- 'Spicy but not too heavy'

The AI actually understands context and mood, not just keywords.

https://cravemap.streamlit.app/

Note: Built by indie developer, not a big tech company!"
```

**E. Value-First Post (for /r/recipes, /r/food)**
```
Title: "When you want to cook but also want someone else to cook for you - found the perfect solution"

Body: "You know that feeling when you're browsing recipes but realize you actually just want someone else to make food for you?

Made this tool that bridges that gap - describe what you're craving (like you would when looking for recipes) and it finds restaurants that serve exactly that.

'Something like homemade tomato soup but better'
'Healthy stir-fry but restaurant quality'
'Comfort food that won't make me feel guilty'

Link: https://cravemap.streamlit.app/

Perfect for when inspiration strikes but motivation doesn't üòÖ"
```
