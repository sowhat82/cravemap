# Remember Me Persistence Fix

## Issue
The "Remember me on this device" feature was not properly persisting user sessions when the Streamlit app rebooted. Users would appear to be logged in (email was restored) but would lose their premium status, monthly search counts, and other session data.

## Root Cause
The original `get_user_email()` function only restored the user's email address from the `.remembered_user.txt` file but did not restore the complete user session data from the database. This meant:

1. ✅ Email was restored correctly
2. ❌ Premium status was lost (defaulted to False)
3. ❌ Monthly search count was lost (defaulted to 0)
4. ❌ Payment completion status was lost
5. ❌ Other user data was not restored

## Solution
Added a new `restore_user_session(email)` function that:

1. **Loads complete user data** from PostgreSQL or SQLite database
2. **Restores all session state variables** including:
   - `user_premium` status
   - `payment_completed` status  
   - `monthly_searches` count
   - `last_search_reset` timestamp
3. **Handles database fallbacks** gracefully
4. **Provides error handling** for edge cases

## Code Changes

### Before (Original Code)
```python
def get_user_email():
    """Get user email through optional login"""
    if 'user_email' not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state['user_email'] = None
    
    # Check for remembered user first
    if not st.session_state['user_email']:
        try:
            with open('.remembered_user.txt', 'r') as f:
                remembered_email = f.read().strip()
                if remembered_email:
                    st.session_state['user_email'] = remembered_email  # Only email restored!
        except:
            pass
    
    return st.session_state['user_email']
```

### After (Fixed Code)
```python
def restore_user_session(email):
    """Restore complete user session data for remembered users"""
    try:
        # Set email in session state
        st.session_state['user_email'] = email
        
        # Load user data from PostgreSQL or SQLite
        user_data = None
        
        # Try PostgreSQL first
        if postgres_db is not None:
            user_data = postgres_db.get_user(email)
        
        # Fallback to SQLite if PostgreSQL fails
        if not user_data and db is not None:
            user_id = hashlib.md5(email.encode()).hexdigest()[:8]
            user_data = load_user_data(user_id)
        
        # Update session state with user data
        if user_data:
            st.session_state.user_premium = bool(user_data.get('is_premium', False))
            st.session_state.payment_completed = bool(user_data.get('payment_completed', False))
            st.session_state.monthly_searches = user_data.get('monthly_searches', 0)
            st.session_state.last_search_reset = user_data.get('last_search_reset', datetime.now().isoformat())
            return True
        
        return False
    except Exception:
        return False

def get_user_email():
    """Get user email through optional login"""
    if 'user_email' not in st.session_state:
        st.session_state['user_email'] = None
    
    # Check for remembered user first
    if not st.session_state['user_email']:
        try:
            with open('.remembered_user.txt', 'r') as f:
                remembered_email = f.read().strip()
                if remembered_email:
                    # Restore complete user session data
                    if restore_user_session(remembered_email):
                        # Only show success message in debug mode to avoid UI clutter
                        if os.getenv('CRAVEMAP_DEBUG', 'false').lower() == 'true':
                            st.sidebar.success(f"Welcome back, {remembered_email}!")
                    else:
                        # If session restore fails, just set the email
                        st.session_state['user_email'] = remembered_email
        except:
            pass
    
    return st.session_state['user_email']
```

## Impact

### Before Fix
- User logs in with "Remember me" checked
- App restarts (due to deployment, inactivity, etc.)
- User appears logged in but:
  - Premium features show as unavailable
  - Search count resets to 0
  - Payment status lost

### After Fix  
- User logs in with "Remember me" checked
- App restarts (due to deployment, inactivity, etc.)
- User session fully restored:
  - ✅ Premium status maintained
  - ✅ Search count preserved
  - ✅ Payment status preserved
  - ✅ All user data intact

## Testing
Created comprehensive tests in `test_remember_me_logic.py` that validate:
- Email restoration works
- Premium status restoration works
- Monthly search count restoration works
- Database fallback scenarios work
- Error handling works correctly

## Compatibility
- ✅ Works with PostgreSQL backend
- ✅ Works with SQLite fallback
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility
- ✅ Graceful error handling for edge cases
- ✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Security Considerations
- File access is properly handled with try/catch blocks
- No sensitive data is logged or exposed
- Session restoration only happens for valid remembered users
- Database queries use existing secure patterns
